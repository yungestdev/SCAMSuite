Wireshark 4.0.4 Release Notes

 What is Wireshark?

  Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
  used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

 What’s New

  We do not ship official 32-bit Windows packages for Wireshark 4.0 and
  later. If you need to use Wireshark on that platform, we recommend
  using the latest 3.6 release. Issue 17779[1]

  If you’re running Wireshark on macOS and upgraded to macOS 13 from an
  earlier version, you will likely have to open and run the “Uninstall
  ChmodBPF” package, then open and run “Install ChmodBPF” in order to
  reset the ChmodBPF Launch Daemon. Issue 18734[2].

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You
   can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can
   be found on the download page[28] on the Wireshark web site.

 File Locations

  Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
  preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These
  locations vary from platform to platform. You can use "Help › About
  Wireshark › Folders" or `tshark -G folders` to find the default
  locations on your system.
